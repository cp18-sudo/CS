Journal Reflection

The DriverPass project was about building a system for a driving school that wanted to help students schedule lessons, track their progress, and prep for their driving test. The client basically needed a system that worked for both students and instructors, while also giving admins a way to keep everything organized.

One thing I think I did really well was laying out the requirements clearly. I made sure everything tied back to the client’s goals instead of just throwing in features that sounded good. If I had to revise something, I’d go back and strengthen the non-functional requirements, like making performance goals and security expectations more specific. That would make the system easier to evaluate later.

When I was designing, I focused a lot on the user side. I made sure to look at their needs, like easy scheduling for students or clear lesson tracking for instructors, and then translated those into features in the design. Keeping user needs front and center matters because if the system doesn’t work for the people actually using it, then it doesn’t matter how “good” the tech side looks.

As for how I approach designing software, I like to start with the problem, break it down into what the users really need, and then map that into models and diagrams to keep it structured. Going forward, I’d keep using strategies like use cases, UML diagrams when needed, and focusing on building systems that can scale while staying simple and easy to use.
